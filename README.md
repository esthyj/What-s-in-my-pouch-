## Project
People get skin troubles when they use cosmetic products that include some particular ingredient, so they want to buy the cosmetic product that fits their skin. There are also people that feel inconvenient when using recommendation apps with complex UI. By apprehending these needs, we designed an app with a simple UI that finds the cosmetic ingredient that doesn’t fit people’s skin and recommends cosmetic products that fits with people’s skin characteristics. This project holds significance in creating an app based on people’s needs identified verified by pre-survey, with the aim of enhancing user convenience. Through post-survey, we could see that people positively evaluated the app. This project was meaningful as it provided opportunities to think about various aspects of Human Computer Interaction.

## Technology
To find the ingredient that doesn’t fit people's skin, we used OCR technology to extract text from the cosmetic product ingredient indication image. 

## Datasets
We crawled OliveYoung data to list the cosmetic products and recommended users the product that matches with their age, skin type, and skin concern.
